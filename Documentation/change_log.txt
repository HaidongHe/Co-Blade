Co-Blade Change Log
=============================================================================

==== v1.00.00 Feb-27-2012  D.C. Sale ========================================
This is the first release of Co-Blade.  


==== v1.00.10 Jun-11-2012  D.C. Sale ========================================
[Update] 
Changed variable names for data structures holding coordinate system 
transformation data.


==== v1.10.00 Aug-13-2012  D.C. Sale ========================================
[Update] 
Added ability to perform gradient based optimization with fmincon() 

[Update] 
Improved the initial guess for structural design variables

[Update] 
Added function defineWebNode to replace code in structAnalysis.m

[Update] 
Added 3D image of blade that represents the current best design of the
optimization algorithm.  Improved visual format of plot that shows
progress of optimization algorithm.

[Bug Fix] 
On rare occasions, the structural analysis can crash (due to being supplied
a bogus design from the optimization algorithm) that will cause the optimization
to also crash.  Added a failsafe with some "catch-try" statements that allows
the optimization to recover from this type of error.

[Bug Fix] 
Added error check to see if BModes.exe exists, if not gives instructions
on how to download/install BModes.

[Bug Fix] 
Added error checking on BModes input so that BModes will not crash (hopefully)
The BModes analysis is skipped if errors are detected.

[Bug Fix] 
Fixed a bug where the new main input file was not created correctly after optimization run.

[Bug Fix] 
Added more rigorous error checking to see if webs extend beyond the leading & trailing edges.

[Bug Fix] 
Fixed a bug in plotLoadsDisp.m that would crash when INTERP_AF = none.


==== v1.20.00 Sept-12-2012  D.C. Sale =======================================
[Update] 
Major re-write of the majority of all Co-Blade source code.  The major change was
to group common variables together into structures, and previous function calls which
had lengthy lists of variables in the input/output arguments were replaced with a much
shorter list of the structures containing the common variables.  This required many other
changes to most source files besides just changing the input/output arguments.  This re-write
reduced the total lines of code, and hopefully also made it easier to understand.

[Update] 
Added a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows for better visualization
of various output parameters in the blade panels and laminas.  This GUI plots
a 3D representation of the turbine blade, and the user can select via a spreadsheet
which panels and/or laminas are shown in the plot.  Also, can select which output
parameter (i.e. Effective modulus, strain, stress, etc.) is visualized in the 
selected panels and/or laminas.

[Update] 
Added a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm.

[Update] 
Modified the format of the input file which allows users to specify the 
initial guess for the strucutural optimization algorithm.  The new format
is much easier to modify, and the format is now identical regardless of the 
number of control points (NUM_CP) that are used in the optimization.

[Update] 
Improved the initial guess for structural design variables, and made
some changes to the hard-coded upper & lower bounds for design variables.

[Update] 
Changed the file extension of the BModes input files to .bmi to differentiate
them from the Co-Blade input files (which have .inp extension).  Also, changed
the file extension of the main input file created after completion of the 
structural optimization algorithm from .inp_oup to .inp and appended _OPT
to the filename to easier differentiate this file.

[Update] 
Created new folder "Optimization_Data" which contains the input files for
optimization algorithm settings and input files for the initial guess of the
design variables.

[Update] 
Updated the wind turbine and tidal turbine example files.

[Update] 
Added some additional documentation about derivation of the transverse shear flow
and torsional shear flow equations (Maple worksheet files).

[Update] 
Added some instructions for installation of Co-Blade in file installation_instructions.txt


==== v1.21.00 Sept-26-2012  D.C. Sale =======================================
[Bug Fix]
Modified some equations for calculating Young's modulus weighted 2nd area moments of inertia.
Hayat Khazar pointed out a possible mistake in the code, so I modified the equations for variables:
(Ix_e_mc, Iy_e_mc, Ixy_e_mc), (Ix_e_tc, Iy_e_tc, Ixy_e_tc), and (Ix_e_sc, Iy_e_sc, Ixy_e_sc) in 
the file structAnalysis.m

[Bug Fix]
Modified the equations for calculating the principal flapwise angle in file principalValues.m.


==== v1.23.00 Dec-29-2012  D.C. Sale =======================================
[Bug Fix]
A bug in the error checking routines prevented users from creating beams with zero shear webs, 
this is fixed now.

[Bug Fix]
The PSO toolbox was giving an error when compiled, made some changes to psocheckinitialpopulation
and it compiles okay now.

[Update]
Compiling with Matlab R2012a and R2012b caused errors when GUI elements in the optimization
tooboxes were called. So I now compiled with Matlab R2011b (v7.13) and Compiler v4.16 with MCR v7.16
and I think everything works now & it is much faster now too.

==== v1.24.00 Jan-21-2013  D.C. Sale =======================================
-added additional error checking for initial conditions of optimization algorithm
-changed default colormaps for all plotting functions (uses Sandia diverging colormap algorithms), and removed transparent figures
-fixed bug with data GUI LE/TE outlines and cross sections being shown for all sections

==== v1.30.00 June-14-2013  D.C. Sale =======================================
-fixed bugs in Particle Swarm algorithm.  Updated to newest 2013 version, and then I added: 
console output for actual function evaluations
new stopping criteria: max function evaluations
-all the new Monte Carlo anlysis from GMREC paper
and 

==== v2.00.00 Dec 2013  D.C. Sale =======================================
[BUGFIX] 
The diverging colormap does not always map the 0 value to the white color.  In other words, sometimes the 0 value appears 
as blue or red.

[refactor] 
all the new Monte Carlo analysis from GMREC paper, clean-up the code!

[feature]  
add capabilities to visualize in VisIt and Paraview

[feature]  
add a basic mesh generator for Material Point Method (MPM), this feature
creates particles in place of the laminas, where the lamina thickness is 
equal to the particle diameter, and particles are centered along the
s-coordinate of each individual lamina.  Well.......................
....maybe this is too much detail...the particle diameter could also 
be equal to the panel thickness with particles centered along the 
s-coordinate of each individual panel...I think this is easier for now.
For the MPM method, I think we need to output the stiffness matrix, mass, stress/strain of each particle
for visualization with VTK.

[feature]  
add 3D printing capabilities to Co-Blade via Matlab FEX implementations,
and print a new rotor via Storti's lab as an example...if possible......
.......can we print aeroelastically scaled rotors (i.e. variable stiffness)?

[fix]
reverted to the v1.30- fitness function, this actually worked better than the GMREC publication...oops
