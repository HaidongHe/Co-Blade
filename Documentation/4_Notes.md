Some people have asked about the underlying theory implemented within the Co-Blade code. The Co-Blade user's guide gives a quick overview of the theory and suggests several books which can explain different parts of the theory in greater detail. The technical approach implemented within Co-Blade can be understood mostly by reading the suggested texts referenced to in the user's guide; however, some differences appear between the Co-Blade implementation and the commonly published approaches. Also, the way some equations are typed in the source code may not look identical to the forms published in the textbooks. This page contains some additional notes which can (hopefully) help to better understand the Co-Blade source code and underlying theory.

There was very little time to organize these notes any better, and the notes published on this page do not currently cover every part of the Co-Blade theory and source code. Time permitting, additional information may be posted in the future. Feel free to contact Danny Sale for further questions and comments.
