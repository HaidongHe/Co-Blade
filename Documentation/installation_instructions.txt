Installation for Co-Blade v1.23.00-dcs
================================================================================

1) If you wish to use BModes with Co-Blade, you will need to download the
   the BModes v3.00.00 executable from: 
   http://wind.nrel.gov/designcodes/preprocessors/bmodes/,
   and place the BModes.exe file in the same directory as the CoBlade.m or
   CoBlade.exe file.

2) If you wish to run the MATLAB version of Co-Blade (i.e. CoBlade.m),
   then you will need to have the "MATLAB Optimization Toolbox" and
   "MATLAB Global Optimization Toolbox" installed if using the optimization
   features of Co-Blade.  If only using Co-Blade in analysis mode, no additional
   MATLAB toolboxes are required.

3) If using the compiled version of Co-Blade (i.e. CoBlade.exe), you do 
   not need MATLAB installed, but you will need to first install
   the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (version MCR v7.16).
   The MATLAB Compiler Runtime is a standalone set of shared libraries 
   that enables the execution of compiled MATLAB applications or components 
   on computers that do not have MATLAB installed.
