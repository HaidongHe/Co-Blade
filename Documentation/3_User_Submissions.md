Cylindrical Beam with Different Composite Layups

Hongli Jia (MS-PhD Candidate of the Structures and Composites Laboratory, Hanyang University) studied a circular beam with different composite layups and compared predictions for stiffness and deflection from the Co-Blade and Abaqus FEM codes. Thanks to Hongli for collaboration on this study!
