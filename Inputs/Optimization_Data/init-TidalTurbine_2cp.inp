0.50            w_cap_inb:      Width of the spar cap normalized by the chord length (x/c) at the INB_STN blade stations.
0.25            w_cap_oub:      Width of the spar cap normalized by the chord length (x/c) at the OUB_STN blade stations.
0.030           t_blade_root:   Thickness of the “blade-root”  material (m) at the INB_STN blade station.
0.010 0.005     t_blade_skin:   Thickness of the “blade-shell” material (m) at control points 1 through NUM_CP (space delimited values).  The control points are equally spaced along the blade between the TRAN_STN and OUB_STN blade stations.
0.020 0.005     t_cap_uni:      Thickness of the “spar-uni”    material (m) at control points 1 through NUM_CP (space delimited values).  The control points are equally spaced along the blade between the TRAN_STN and OUB_STN blade stations.
0.001 0.001     t_cap_core:     Thickness of the “spar-core”   material (m) at control points 1 through NUM_CP (space delimited values).  The control points are equally spaced along the blade between the TRAN_STN and OUB_STN blade stations.
0.006 0.003     t_lep_core:     Thickness of the “LEP-core”    material (m) at control points 1 through NUM_CP (space delimited values).  The control points are equally spaced along the blade between the TRAN_STN and OUB_STN blade stations.
0.010 0.005     t_tep_core:     Thickness of the “TEP-core”    material (m) at control points 1 through NUM_CP (space delimited values).  The control points are equally spaced along the blade between the TRAN_STN and OUB_STN blade stations.
0.003 0.003     t_web_skin:     Thickness of the “web-shell”   material (m) at the two control points located at INB_STN and OUB_STN (space delimited values).
0.005 0.005     t_web_core:     Thickness of the “web-core”    material (m) at the two control points located at INB_STN and OUB_STN (space delimited values).
